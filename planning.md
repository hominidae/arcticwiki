# Project Planning
## Wireless and RF systems
Wireless networking:
I will be testing a >5KM link with a pair of Ubiquiti Networks Nanostation 5AC Loco devices in the next couple of weeks. If the tests go well, I will be rolling out a community wireless network for serving up free open source content like Wikipedia, Ted Talks, etc.

LoraWAN networking:
I will also be testing a small LoraWAN network using a [LoraWAN gateway](https://www.robotshop.com/ca/en/lg01-p-lora-gateway-915-mhz-north-america.html) and an [LSN50](https://www.robotshop.com/ca/en/lsn50-waterproof-long-range-wireless-lora-sensor-node-915-mhz.html) I picked up from [Robotshop.com](http://www.robotshop.com/ca/)

Arctic ADS-B Receiver(s): This is part of a future project to provide localized flight tracking systems to several remote arctic communities for the purposes of public safety.
I have ordered five AirNav Radarbox Flightsticks, these are specially designed specifically for ADS-B and are pretty economical.
I am also waiting on five PCB high gain ADS-B antennas. Pair these both with a Raspbery Pi Zero W and you have a pretty cool project.

Software Defined Radio:
I have ordered a low noise amplifier and an upconverter for receipt of HF transmissions (Shortwave, AM radio, etc).
I already have a KerberoSDR which I'm looking at playing with as soon as I find a decent source for SMA connectors and RF cable.

SATNOGS:
Future tower system being planned for tracking passing satellites. I will likely fold in some form of reception for actively tracking satellites and constructing a multi-purpose RF reception tower. I'm planning on setting it up to eventually be capable of high gain reception of a variety of RF signals.

## Plant monitoring systems
AGI-ESP8266 project still in progress, a dozen esp8266 microcontrollers on hand pending completion of a side project for accurately bending copper pipe into fancy shapes.

Todo:
3D print planters and figure out sealant
~Purchase seeds~ Seeds are ready
Purchase components for building sand filled copper pipe bending CNC unit (Required for automating soil temperature window sill thermoregulation)
