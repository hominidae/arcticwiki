<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Arctic Tiny House -->

# Concept
I'd like to live off the grid in the arctic. As a result, I'm exploring technology related systems in order to make that happen.

## 1. Structure
The design that I have chosen is a triangular shaped tiny house/cabin. The purpose for choosing that shape is the design is simple and it will allow the lateral beams to support a lot of weight.

The reason that a lot of weight will need to be supported is I would like to also test a theory I have regarding the use of snow as an insulative barrier between the exterior ambient air temperature of -48 degree's celsius.

A preliminary test has concluded that approximately 1 foot of snow will provide enough insulation to raise the interior temperature to -19 degree's celsius.

However to do that, the exterior membrane will need to be sealed in multiple steps and completely water proof since the majority of the melt off from the snow will melt off in the spring.

While I do want to test vacuum insulated panels in the future, I would like to test the first design iteration of this tiny cabin with conventional R20 fibreglass batt insulation.

In addition to the exterior membrane needing to be water proof, I also want to design the exterior with easily replaceable 1x4 by 8 foot boards to use as baffles to hold the snow in place.

Here is an excellent article on [a basic A-frame cabin design.](http://www.homedesigninteriors.com/how-to-build-an-a-frame-tiny-house-cabin.html)

In future iterations of the cabin design, I will try different heating systems to gather more data on non-electric heating fuel burning heating systems.

### Space Calculation
Since the interior heating requirement to maintain the heaters efficient size is 144 square feet, the use of a trianglular shaped A-frame reduces the overall space that needs to be heated.

In addition, the unusable space below 5 feet that cannot be considered living space can however be used as storage.

And because the triangular A-frame is only being used to distribute the exterior weight of the snow, it isn't necessary to utilize insulation on the outer frame below the 5 foot threshold.

What that means, is that the A-frame will still resemble a traditional box frame home, however, it will only resemble a traditional box frame when viewed from the interior.

When the tiny home/cabin is viewed from the exterior, the outside membrane will still have the appearance of a giant triangle wedge. The triangle wedge will also need to be built in line with the prevailing wind direction from the north.

In addition, because the sleeping area is intended to occupy the upper most portion of the triangle to allow for additional energy efficiency at night by reducing heating fuel usage the floor to ceiling must be at minimum 6 feet from the second recessed story.

While it's tempting to add a lot of windows, windows and entry ways in the arctic are a major area for heat loss to occur.

The formula for calculating the area of a rectangle is length times width. However, when calculating a triangle that formula becomes side a times side b times the base. The result of that is the square footage.

Let's say we made an insulated base that was 12 feet by 16 feet. That's the pad. If that were a rectangle, the square footage would be 192 square feet.

However, it isn't. We're using a triangle.

How do we do some basic math to find the length of sides a and b? We know the base is 12 feet long. We also know that we should not consider any space under 5 feet to be living space. This is important because if it isn't living space, we are likely going to install storage space there. If we're installing storage space there, it likely won't be actively heated.

So, we need to calculate 144 square feet of empty space.

To do this, we're going to borrow the calculations from [here.](https://www.spikevm.com/how-to/gable-sq-ft.php)

We will use those calculations to find out the minimum height we will need to place a raised second floor for a bed. The size of the bed is approximately 7 feet long.

Now that we have a bunch of numbers, we should consider putting them all in one place:
144 square feet minimum for empty space
7 feet minimum for second level bed lengthwise between sides a and sides b
6 feet minimum for head height of second story
12 feet for side c aka base

So, we need to find the required length of sides a and sides b based on that.

## 2. Utilities

### Heat
The first thing to consider heat. There are two routes that can be taken, the first is using an electric heater and the second is using a drip heater.

Since the tiny home/cabin will be the first off-grid tiny home/cabin I will be building and there are periods where it would potentially be without power as I figure out solar and wind power systems, the best approach is to use a heating system that doesn't require power.

The heater I am looking at is the [Trekker Diesel Space Heater.](https://www.portablespaceheater.ca/trekker/)

It will heat approximately 144 square feet of space on it's lowest setting. I don't have any data on combustion efficiency or anything, but I do plan on setting up the electronics to monitor that.

### Power
Solar power? Wind power? Diesel electric generator?

For eight months of the year, solar isn't an option. However, that isn't to say solar isn't an option for summer months. However, I still need to collect quite a bit of data on things like wind load, construction methods, mounting hardware, and power electronics related hardware. (MPPT vs PWM)

Wind is a good option, and it may be the first item I begin testing. I have several brushed DC motors which I can convert into wind turbines. In addition, it would likely be effective year round.

A diesel electric generator is a good idea as a back-up in the event that the renewable energy options are not sufficient. In addition, to needing a lot of batteries to store power and to keep them warm having an option to generate diesel power for periods of high energy usage is likely a good idea.

## 3. Luxuries/amenities

### Water:
Most of the water for this unit will need to be transported personally. As a result, amenities like running cold and hot water will need to be carefully considered.

Once I perform measurements and approximate calculations on water usage, I can estimate approximate tank size and required transport capabilities needed to keep a week's worth of water in reserve.

The alternative involves placing the tiny home/cabin near a fresh water lake and pumping water fresh water into the tank every now and then.

### Living space:
The living area of the tiny home will need to be carefully considered. There will need to be a single queen sized or double bed installed at the rafters to reduce heating use at night.

The living room area will need to serve multiple roles.

### Washrooms:
A working septic system isn't in the cards...yet. As a result, an outhouse will likely need to be built nearby. God willing, I can also add a heated toilet seat to it. No one wants to drop a deuce sitting on a cold seat in the winter. That includes me. xD

## 4. Design deadline:
The design deadline will be roughly approximated with the second sailing in this [PDF document via NEAS.ca](https://neas.ca/wp-content/uploads/sailing_schedule.pdf)

Most of the construction material should be sourced locally, but a lot of the specialized equipment and hardware should make it on that barge. The Diesel electric generator, trekker fuel stove and various items will need to be ready for packaging in Montreal by July 19th.

## 5. Improvements:
Iterative improvements will likely take place as more information and data is gathered. This will likely include constructions techniques, hardware and renewable energy power systems.

The biggest area for improvement will likely be in ventilation and heating. The Trekker fuel stove is a relatively primitive drip stove, but improvements could likely be power electric heater systems marketed towards rural cabin owners and maritime small vessel operators. A sister project of the tiny home is the portable diesel space heater project [here.](http://wiki.arctichominid.ca/diesel-space-heater) If that design can be optimized and it can run efficiently with little build-up of soot, it could be a decent alternative to expensive, larger systems. Mixing the appropriate air to fuel ratio is key however, as the latest results from experiments have determined that the existing system burns rich and results in excessive carbon build-up in the primary combustion chamber.

In addition, one avenue I would like to explore is using a snow cover based heating ventilation recovery system. If the space under one foot of snow is warmer than outside ambient air by approximately 15 degree's, introducing cold exterior air or warm interior air to a secondary space that is in between it would mean much less condensation would occur. If it did occur, the optimization of a large surface area for condensation to occur would likely be a more optimal approach than concentrating condensation into a relatively tiny enclosed metal space. A basic design concept behind that approach would be to borrow simple relativistic physical principles behind the use septic systems in rural areas where the calculation of approximate linear feet of surface area to distributed volume of liquid, or in our case, gas is applied. So-and-so much air produces so-and-so much moisture condensate per square foot.

The same principles for that could also be an avenue to pursue in regard to placing heated under-snow areas for large diameter PVC pipe to house LED lit growing areas for lettuce, kale, spinach and other leafy vegetables that love colder temperatures between 10 degree's and 0 degree's.
