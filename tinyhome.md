<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Arctic Tiny House -->

# Concept
I'd like to live off the grid in the arctic. As a result, I'm exploring technology related systems in order to make that happen.

## 1. Structure
I've chosen to build a triangular shaped tiny house because I believe that it will allow me to construct the strongest possible shape for placing approximately a foot of snow onto the exterior walls.

Since snow placed on the exterior walls will have a tendancy to slough downwards, I'm planning on adding a number of snow baffles along the exterior surface.

The exterior will need to be covered in aluminum metal siding, with stand-offs for the placement of wooden 1x4 rails at every foot vertically along the exterior surfaces. The 1x4 rails will hold any snow in place and prevent it from immediately sloping downwards during periods of melting. The selection of 1x4 wood was chosen because it's cheaply available and easily replaced.

Here is an excellent article on [the basic design.](http://www.homedesigninteriors.com/how-to-build-an-a-frame-tiny-house-cabin.html)

## 2. Utilities

### Heat
The first thing to consider heat. There are two routes that can be taken, the first is using an electric heater and the second is using a drip heater.

Since the tiny home/cabin will be offgrid and potentially without power, the best approach is to use a system that doesn't require power.

This is the heater I am looking at for that, the [Trekker Diesel Space Heater.](https://www.portablespaceheater.ca/trekker/)

### Power
Solar power? Wind power? Diesel electric generator?

To be determined.

## 3. Luxaries/amenities
To be determined.
