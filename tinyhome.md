<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Arctic Tiny House -->

# Concept
I'd like to live off the grid in the arctic. As a result, I'm exploring technology related systems in order to make that happen.

## 1. Structure
The design that I have chosen is a triangular shaped tiny house/cabin. The purpose for choosing that shape is the design is simple and it will allow the lateral beams to support a lot of weight.

The reason that a lot of weight will need to be supported is I would like to also test a theory I have regarding the use of snow as an insulative barrier between the exterior ambient air temperature of -48 degree's celsius.

A preliminary test has concluded that approximately 1 foot of snow will provide enough insulation to raise the interior temperature to -19 degree's celsius.

However to do that, the exterior membrane will need to be sealed and water proof. While I do want to test vacuum insulated panels in the future, I would like to test the first design iteration of this tiny cabin with conventional R20 fibreglass batt insulation.

In addition to the exterior membrane needing to be water proof, I also want to design the exterior with easily replaceable 1x4 by 8 foot boards to use as baffles to hold the snow in place.

Here is an excellent article on [a basic A-frame cabin design.](http://www.homedesigninteriors.com/how-to-build-an-a-frame-tiny-house-cabin.html)

## 2. Utilities

### Heat
The first thing to consider heat. There are two routes that can be taken, the first is using an electric heater and the second is using a drip heater.

Since the tiny home/cabin will be the first off-grid tiny home/cabin I will be building and there are periods where it would potentially be without power as I figure out solar and wind power systems, the best approach is to use a heating system that doesn't require power.

The heater I am looking at is the [Trekker Diesel Space Heater.](https://www.portablespaceheater.ca/trekker/)

It will heat approximately 144 square feet of space on it's lowest setting. I don't have any data on combustion efficiency or anything, but I do plan on setting up the electronics to monitor that.

### Power
Solar power? Wind power? Diesel electric generator?

For eight months of the year, solar isn't an option. However, that isn't to say solar isn't an option for summer months. However, I still need to collect quite a bit of data on things like wind load, construction methods, mounting hardware, and power electronics related hardware. (MPPT vs PWM)

Wind is a good option, and it may be the first item I begin testing. I have several brushed DC motors which I can convert into wind turbines. In addition, it would likely be effective year round.

A diesel electric generator is a good idea as a back-up in the event that the renewable energy options are not sufficient. In addition, to needing a lot of batteries to store power and to keep them warm having an option to generate diesel power for periods of high energy usage is likely a good idea.

## 3. Luxuries/amenities

### Water:
Most of the water for this unit will need to be transported personally. As a result, amenities like running cold and hot water will need to be carefully considered.

Once I perform measurements and approximate calculations on water usage, I can estimate approximate tank size and required transport capabilities needed to keep a week's worth of water in reserve.

The alternative involves placing the tiny home/cabin near a fresh water lake and pumping water fresh water into the tank every now and then.

### Living space:
The living area of the tiny home will need to be carefully considered. There will need to be a single queen sized or double bed installed at the rafters to reduce heating use at night.

The living room area will need to serve multiple roles.

### Washrooms:
A working septic system isn't in the cards...yet. As a result, an outhouse will likely need to be built nearby. God willing, I can also add a heated toilet seat to it. No one wants to drop a deuce sitting on a cold seat in the winter. That includes me. xD

## 4. Design deadline
The design deadline will be roughly approximated with the second sailing in this [PDF document via NEAS.ca](https://neas.ca/wp-content/uploads/sailing_schedule.pdf)

Most of the construction material should be sourced locally, but a lot of the specialized equipment and hardware should make it on that barge.
