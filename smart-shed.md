# Concept
The general concept of the "smart shed" is to construct several sheds with data monitoring equipment to operate in situ with greenhouse hardware.

## Design 1:
The first design was started last fall. It's an 8'x8'x8' shed with 2x4 boards for the studs and R20 fibreglass insulation. The exterior will be wrapped with Tyvek and the interior wrapped with 6 Mil polyethylene vapour barrier.

It's a pretty generic setup. Heat will be provided by a portable diesel electric heater that puts out 17,000 BTU's.

## Design 2:
Same as above, but with 2x6 studs and R40 insulation. The interior dimensions are quite a bit less, but the overall efficiency should be improved.
