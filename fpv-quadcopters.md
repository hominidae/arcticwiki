<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Fpv Quadcopters -->

# FPV Quadcopters:
I currently have two 5" FPV Quadcopters that I'm working on.

Todo:
- Silicone conformal coating required to waterproof electronics
- Slica aerogel battery blanket required for LiPo's
- Sort out camera and VTX issues, one Foxeer camera appears to be NTSC or shorted from destroyed PDB

These have really died in the water so to speak as I don't have an effective method of protecting the electronics against melting snow...yet.
