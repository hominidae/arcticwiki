# Portable Film Setup
## Description:
I have acquired two Runcam 3S action cameras from [Banggood.](https://www.banggood.com/Runcam-3S-WIFI-1080p-60fps-WDR-160-Degree-FPV-Action-Camera-Detachable-Battery-for-RC-Racing-Drone-p-1338456.html?rmmds=search&cur_warehouse=CN)

There is an excellent review of these cameras from Oscar liang [here.](https://oscarliang.com/runcam-3s-camera/)

Now these cameras can record 1080P at 60FPS and they're commonly used for FPV quad copter racing. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnrZbmLtPvc) is a video of what that looks like.

The purpose of this page is to document my work at assembling a portable tripod mount for the Runcam 3S and adding a portable 18650 battery pack to power the Runcam 3S for pro-longed usage as a youtube filming rig.

In addition, my nephew has an older GoPro Hero 3. I will be 3D printing the mounting accessories and power pack to be compatible with both.

There are also rumours that the Runcam 4 will be out soon. I am hoping to build a long distance FPV flying wing and that would be perfect for that application because the Runcam 4 will do 4K video at 30FPS, 2.7K at 60FPS, and 1080P at 100FPS. One of those would be a major [visual upgrade.](https://oscarliang.com/runcam-4-hd-camera/)

## Runcam Mount with GoPro adapter
The Runcam 3S has a slightly larger profile than the GoPro Session 5. This means that custom mounting hardware will need to be designed to fit the Runcam 3S. I'm in the middle of working on that with my little brother now.  The Runcam 3S comes with two handy velcro straps. I am looking at using these to attach the Runcam 3S to a custom 3D printed mount which will need a GoPro mount adapter.

## GoPro Tripod Mount
Luckily, there are already a large number of 3D printed designs for mounting a GoPro to a Tripod using a standard Tripod screw. And, they're compatible with GoPro enclosures so this is a no brainer.

## Power pack
The Runcam 3S comes with a microUSB adapter that can be connected to an external power supply. As a result, I will be looking at powering the Runcam 3S for prolonged recording with a battery pack consisting of several recycled 18650 battery cells, a TP4056 battery protection integrated circuit and a 3D printed battery case. Basically, its a slightly bigger and smarter version of the portable USB packs you can already purchase.

## Cooling
One major issue with the Runcam 3S is that since it's designed to be as lightweight as possible there were sacrifices made. The first is that the Runcam 3S tends to run hot. That isn't an issue when the Runcam 3S is being flown on a quadcopter which has a number of fans blowing air over it's surfaces keeping it cool. However, if I plan on using the Runcam 3S to record youtube videos of various DIY builds and other work I will need to keep the cameras cool using a custom 3D printed fan adapter. This ties into the runcam mount adapter as it'll likely need to be compatible with mounting a small 40mm fan.
