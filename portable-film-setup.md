# Portable Film Setup
## Description:
I have acquired two Runcam 3S action cameras from [Banggood.](https://www.banggood.com/Runcam-3S-WIFI-1080p-60fps-WDR-160-Degree-FPV-Action-Camera-Detachable-Battery-for-RC-Racing-Drone-p-1338456.html?rmmds=search&cur_warehouse=CN)

There is an excellent review of these cameras from Oscar liang [here.](https://oscarliang.com/runcam-3s-camera/)

Now these cameras can record 1080P at 60FPS and they're commonly used for FPV quad copter racing. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnrZbmLtPvc) is a video of what that looks like.

The purpose of this page is to document my work at assembling a portable tripod mount for the Runcam 3S and adding a portable 18650 battery pack to power the Runcam 3S for pro-longed usage as a youtube filming rig.

In addition, my nephew has an older GoPro Hero 3. I will be 3D printing the mounting accessories and power pack to be compatible with both.
