# Diesel Space Heater
One of the things I am looking at is using compact, portable diesel air heaters as light weight space heaters for use in arctic conditions.

There are diesel air heaters like the Webasto and Espar brand heaters that are used to heat heavy equipment, RV's, campers and mobile homes.

So, I purchased a cheap chinese knock off of one. It's available here at [Banggood](https://www.banggood.com/24V12V-5kw-Diesel-Air-Parking-Heater-Diesel-Heating-Air-Parking-Heater-with-Digital-Switch-p-1252913.html)

## The specifications
But first, let's explain the specs.

The Diesel air heater I ordered runs on 12 volts DC. It puts out approximately 17,000 BTU's and seems to use about 6 Amps of current. The unit cost is roughly $220 Canadian.

In terms of electricity usage for portable power, the power usage is quite high. Most of that power is used to keep the glow plug inside the combustion chamber hot.

Here's a simple calculation:

power (watts) = voltage * amps

12 * 6 = 72 watts

In our case, we're using 72 watts of power. 12 volts multipled by 6 amps is 72 watts.

So, if we're going to take one of these diesel air heaters and make it portable we're going to need to overcome a couple of issues. The first is how we are going to generate approximately 80 watts to run the thing.

We could use wind power, but that could be inconsistent. The wind isn't blowing all the time. Additionally, batteries aren't reliable in extreme temperatures. And conventional lead acid batteries are too heavy.

## Portable source of power

The only practically effective way to generate 12VDC and 6 amps of current in the field in remote arctic locations sadly does not involve using alternative energy like solar or wind.

While wind power could likely do the job using a larger wind generator setup, that would require a fixed installation and that is not practically possible from the back of a towed snowmobile sled.

That could be explored in the future, but for now using a light weight gas powered generator and an inverter might be the best course of action.

This presents an issue. Most four stroke gasoline generators on the market are light weight enough but they also come with their own problem. They use gasoline.

Commonly, while travelling in the arctic you're using gasoline to run your snowmobile. And that means you have a potentially very serious question, what happens if you run out?

Do you double down and carry a lot of gasoline and some diesel or kerosene for heat?

There are multiple reports that these small heaters can run reliably on kerosene and deal with less fouling and soot buildup as a result.

That may be worth exploring.

## First report:
The diesel air heater was running for several weeks between the months of January and March. The unit itself was moved a couple of times and resulted in a small fire. The fire was extinguished, but the cause was isolated
to the exhaust system. While a carbon monoxide detector was purchased to measure air quality, it appears that it was unplugged at the time of the fire. Luckily, a passerby noticed the flames and the fire was put out.

A major issue is how to deal with exhaust. Obviously, a better solution is needed. In addition, upon examination of the exhaust tubing it appears that the exhaust was covered in caked on black tar/soot. At a critical junction
point between the exhaust tubing and a bulkhead, a non-exhaust tube was used to vent the exhaust outside using high temperature aluminum tape. That is what melted and started the fire.

After doing more reading, it appears that this is a common problem. So, I'm currently exploring solutions to the soot build-up and a better method of dealing with hot exhaust gas.

Obviously, safety is going to be a major determining factor in the next prototype build. On top of constant vigilance, the necessity of air quality monitoring, fire alarm monitoring and serviceable fire extinguishers are going to
be necessary safety precautions.
