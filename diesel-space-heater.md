# Diesel Space Heater
One of the things I am looking at is using compact, portable diesel air heaters as space heaters in arctic conditions.

There are diesel air heaters like the Webasto and Espar brand heaters that are used to heat heavy equipment, RV's, campers and mobile homes.

So, I purchased a cheap chinese knock off of one. It's available here at [Banggood](https://www.banggood.com/24V12V-5kw-Diesel-Air-Parking-Heater-Diesel-Heating-Air-Parking-Heater-with-Digital-Switch-p-1252913.html)

The reason I am doing this is I would like to examine one of these for use as a safe, portable heating system in arctic conditions.

## The specifications
But first, let's explain the specs.

The Diesel air heater I ordered runs on 12 volts DC. It puts out approximately 17,000 BTU's and seems to use about 6 Amps of current. The unit cost is roughly $220 Canadian.

In terms of electricity usage for portable power, that's actually quite a bit. Most of that power is used to keep the glow plug inside the combustion chamber hot.

power (watts) = voltage * amps

12 * 6 = 72 watts

So, if we're going to take one of these diesel air heaters and make it portable we're going to need to overcome a couple of issues. The first is how we are going to generate approximately 80 watts to run the thing.

We could use wind power, but that would be inconsistent. Additionally, batteries aren't reliable in extreme temperatures. And conventional lead acid batteries are heavy.

## The problem
The only practically effective way to generate 12VDC and 6 amps of current in the field in remote arctic locations sadly does not involve using alternative energy like solar or wind.

While wind power could likely do the job using a larger wind generator setup, and a fixed installation it's not practically possible from the back of a snow mobile sled.

I may expore that in future, but for now we're probably going to need to look at instead using a light weight generator and an inverter.

This presents an issue. Most four stroke gasoline generators on the market are light weight enough but they also come with their own problem. They use gasoline.

Commonly, while travelling in the arctic you're using gasoline to run your snowmobile. And that means you have a potentially very serious question, what happens if you run out?

You don't get home. Let's call that a very bad thing to have happen. You want to go home. To do that you need your gas.

So, we need to find a fuel that we can carry with us and use for generating electricity and generating heat. This simplifies fuel storage as we can overload on a fuel and carefully manage gasoline usage for
travel.

That wonderful fuel is diesel. Specifically, P-50 arctic diesel.

## The possible solution
The solution to this problem involves finding a lightweight diesel electric generator that can provide enough power to power the diesel electric heater, provide adequete LED lighting,
charge any personal electronics, and in emergencies start snowmobiles and re-charge snow mobile batteries.

That solution sounds like it might be imaginary.

I don't necessarily like re-inventing the wheel. What I prefer to do is what I have already done with security, alarm and surveillance systems for much of the last decade.
Intelligent solutions involve integrating existing systems manufactured by subject matter experts who put out the best available and affordable functional products.

If someone already builds a serviceable wheel, and all it needs is something to attach it to; it's your responsibility to attach it your hub.

So, the solution requires exploring available technology, hardware and equipment that fulfill the very limited and rigidly defined specifications we've just defined.

We need to find a generator that runs on diesel. It also needs to be lightweight and easy to ship.

An inverter will need to be attached to it. That generator and inverter will need to power the heater and other systems for prolonged periods of time in between
maintenace and if maintenance needs to be performed, it should be possible to do so in the field.

## The hunt is on for the right diesel generator
I will begin documenting the search for a light weight diesel generator here. I have looked at several already, but they are almost all bulky, rather heavy and expensive.

So far, most of what I've been reading relies on solutions for sailing and small boats.

One such resource I have found is [here.](http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f14/small-1kw-diesel-generator-101684.html)

It's a fascinating read and is illustrative of the kind of diesel generator required for use in the arctic.

### The results so far:
Here are the best options I've found so far:
[The Flex-Lite 2.5kW Diesel generator](http://www.aet.ca/index.php?section=50)
[The Polar-Lite 2.4kW Diesel generator](http://www.aet.ca/index.php?section=51)

Either of these options is desirable since the both weigh only 108lbs and 110lbs respectively.

They also put out a little bit over 2,000 watts. That is plenty for running a variety of tasks.

If your snow mobile won't start you can attach a block heater to it and recharge the battery if needed.

### Other alternatives:
One of the possible solutions to the portable power problem is building and assembling a miniature diesel stirling engine. Unfortunately, almost all motors on the market are designed for high output applications as there does not
appear to be a market for 1kW to 3kW diesel generator engine designs.

While small diesel engines can be found in the 108 to 110 lb weight catergory, they are not ideal since the installation of additional equipment is needed.

One possible solution is to explore building a stirling engine with an atkinson cycle to ensure optimized and nearly complete fuel combustion. When coupled with a catalytic converter, the exhaust would be extremely minimal.

# Application
Provided the power issue can be overcome with a lightweight diesel generator, theoretically you could then embark on very long duration snow mobile trips.

This could be accomplished using a single snowmobile and komatik to carry the diesel generator and all the diesel (P-50) fuel to run it. Extension cables could then be run to other box komatik sleds to power the diesel air heaters installed on them.

The box komatik sleds would need to provide a small bit of very spartan living space, insulation and a carefully designed system to provide heat for the occupant of the sled box. The diesel air heater would provide an ample amount of heat for the size of the sled box but the air quality within the sled box would need to be carefully monitored to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning if the exhaust system from the diesel air heater ever malfunctioned or experienced a leak.
