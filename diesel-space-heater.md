# Diesel Space Heater
One of the things I am looking at is using compact, portable diesel air heaters as light weight space heaters for use in arctic conditions.

There are diesel air heaters like the Webasto and Espar brand heaters that are used to heat heavy equipment, RV's, campers and mobile homes.

So, I purchased a cheap chinese knock off of one. It's available here at [Banggood](https://www.banggood.com/24V12V-5kw-Diesel-Air-Parking-Heater-Diesel-Heating-Air-Parking-Heater-with-Digital-Switch-p-1252913.html)

## The specifications
But first, let's explain the specs.

The Diesel air heater I ordered runs on 12 volts DC. It puts out approximately 17,000 BTU's and seems to use about 6 Amps of current. The unit cost is roughly $220 Canadian.

In terms of electricity usage for portable power, the power usage is quite high. Most of that power is used to keep the glow plug inside the combustion chamber hot.

Here's a simple calculation:

power (watts) = voltage * amps

12 * 6 = 72 watts

In our case, we're using 72 watts of power. 12 volts multipled by 6 amps is 72 watts.

So, if we're going to take one of these diesel air heaters and make it portable we're going to need to overcome a couple of issues. The first is how we are going to generate approximately 80 watts to run the thing.

We could use wind power, but that could be inconsistent. The wind isn't blowing all the time. Additionally, batteries aren't reliable in extreme temperatures. And conventional lead acid batteries are too heavy.

## The problem
The only practically effective way to generate 12VDC and 6 amps of current in the field in remote arctic locations sadly does not involve using alternative energy like solar or wind.

While wind power could likely do the job using a larger wind generator setup, that would require a fixed installation and that is not practically possible from the back of a towed snowmobile sled.

That could be explored in the future, but for now using a light weight gas powered generator and an inverter might be the best course of action.

This presents an issue. Most four stroke gasoline generators on the market are light weight enough but they also come with their own problem. They use gasoline.

Commonly, while travelling in the arctic you're using gasoline to run your snowmobile. And that means you have a potentially very serious question, what happens if you run out?

There are multiple reports that these small heaters can run reliably on kerosene and deal with less fouling and soot buildup as a result.

That may be worth exploring.
