# Diesel Space Heater
One of the things I am looking at is using compact, portable diesel air heaters as space heaters in arctic conditions.

There are diesel air heaters like the Webasto and Espar brand heaters that are used to heat heavy equipment, RV's, campers and mobile homes.

So, I purchased a cheap chinese knock off of one. It's available here at [Banggood](https://www.banggood.com/24V12V-5kw-Diesel-Air-Parking-Heater-Diesel-Heating-Air-Parking-Heater-with-Digital-Switch-p-1252913.html)

The reason I am doing this is I would like to examine one of these for use as a safe, portable heating system in arctic conditions.

## The specifications
But first, let's explain the specs.

The Diesel air heater I ordered runs on 12 volts DC. It puts out approximately 17,000 BTU's and seems to use about 6 amps of juice.

In terms of electricity usage for portable power, that's actually quite a bit. Most of that power is used to keep the glow plug inside the combustion chamber hot.

So, if we're going to take one of these diesel air heaters and make it portable we're going to need to overcome a couple of issues.

## The problem
The only practically effective way to generate 12VDC and 6 amps of current in the field in remote arctic locations sadly does not involve using alternative energy like solar or wind. While wind power could likely do the job using a larger wind generator setup, it's not practically possible from the back of a snow mobile sled.

I may expore that in future, but for now we're probably going to need to look at using a light weight generator and an inverter.

This presents an issue. Most four stroke gasoline generators on the market are light weight enough but they also come with their own problem. They use gasoline. Commonly, while travelling in the arctic you're using gasoline to run your snowmobile.

And that means you have very serious questions like what happens if you run out? You don't get home. Let's call that a very bad thing to have happen.

So, we need to find a fuel that we can carry with us and use for generating electricity and generating heat. This simplifies fuel storage as we can overload a fuel that runs longer and consistently.

That wonderful fuel is diesel.

## The possible solution
The solution involves finding a lightweight diesel electric generator that can provide enough power to power the diesel electric heater, provide adequete LED lighting, charge any personal electronics, and in emergencies start snowmobiles and re-charge snow mobile batteries.

That solution sounds like it might be imaginary. But technologically, it's within our reach.

I don't necessarily like re-inventing the wheel. What I prefer to do is what I have already done with security, alarm and surveillance systems for much of the last decade. Intelligent solutions involve integrating existing systems manufactured by subject matter experts who put out the best available and affordable functional products.

So, the solution requires exploring available technology, hardware and equipment that fulfill our very limited and rigidly defined specifications.

We need to find a generator that runs on diesel. It needs to be lightweight and easy to ship. An inverter will need to be attached to it. That generator and inverter will need to power the heater and other systems for prolonged periods of time in between maintenace and if maintenance needs to be performed, it should be possible to do so in the field.

## The hunt is on for the right diesel generator
I will begin documenting the search for a light weight diesel generator here. I have looked at several already, but they are usually bulky and rather heavy.

So far, most of what I've been reading relies on solutions for sailing and small boats. One such resource I have found is [here.](http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f14/small-1kw-diesel-generator-101684.html) It's a fascinating read and is illustrative of the kind of diesel generator required.
