# Solder fume extractor
This is a quick, dirty solder fume extractor. I found more elaborate designs, but they were way too complicated than they really needed to be.

These are instructions to build and assemble a quick and efficient solder fume extractor. I originally stumbled on [this](https://oscarliang.com/diy-solder-smoke-extractor/) design and it piqued my interest, however there are a couple of problems with Oscar Liang's design. The first is it's kind of complicated. I didn't need a bunch of the features he added and to be completely honest, overhangs on 3D printed parts are a bad idea.

To start with, you'll need a 120mm computer fan. They generally run on 12 Volts DC. I didn't need to control the fan speed so I simply didn't connect that wire to anything. I might look into upgrading that down the road but for now, this works just fine.

Second, I needed a 3D design that was logically simple. I stumbled across many that were kinda nutty, with more curved surfaces than you can shake a stick at and requiring more supports than necessary. Then I found the ideal design [here.](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1062368)

That design by Thingiverse user "tahustvedt" already comes with legs integrated into the print and it's really dead simple to print. The advantage of this design is that the bare minimum of filament is needed to achieve the mission objective.

I added a couple of 2-pin Dupont connectors to the wire and used a 12VDC 1A wall plugin power supply to power the fan. It works pretty slick.
