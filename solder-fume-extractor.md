# Solder fume extractor
This is a quick, dirty solder fume extractor. I found more elaborate designs, but they were way too complicated than they really needed to be.

First off, I had a couple of spare 120mm computer fans. They generally run on 12 volts DC. I didn't need the PWM control, so I simply didn't connect it.

Second, I needed a 3D design that was logically simple. I stumbled across many that were kinda nutty, with more curved surfaces than you can shake a stick at and requiring more supports than necessary. I found the ideal design [here.](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1062368)

That design comes with legs and it's dead simple to print using the bare minimum of filament to achieve the mission objective. The added a couple of dupont connectors to the wire and snipped the ends off a 12VDC 1A power supply, then re-did the end with another dupont connector.
