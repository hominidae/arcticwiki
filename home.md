# Priority List:
## Todo:
- Outfit construction seacan module for building off-grid cabin with woodworking tools/equipment
- Plan materials list for MTS barge shipment; complete NLT July 10th
- Update Arctic Tiny Home project page with revised planning document/design/etc
- Create modular greenhouse design page based on 8 feet x 8 feet x 8 feet modular "smart shed" design for insulation methods testing
## Wiki issues:
I am currently attempting to figure out why I can't submit photos to the wiki. Once I figure that out, more updates will occur.
# Ongoing Projects
[Diesel Space Heater](http://wiki.arctichominid.ca/diesel-space-heater)
   I have begun testing a 17,000 BTU diesel air heater. I'm exploring it's potential use as a portable heater for use in arctic conditions.
[Hypercube 3D Printer build](http://wiki.arctichominid.ca/hypercube)
   A project involving the construction of a 200x200x200 3D printer.
[Supercapacitor Boost Pack](http://wiki.arctichominid.ca/supercapacitor-boost-pack)
   I stole Thor's hammer and I'm using it to power things. Examples include portable power, automotive instant rechargable boost pack and automotive battery replacement.
[IoT block heater](http://wiki.arctichominid.ca/io-t-block-heater)
   I am looking at using an iTead Sonoff POW2 to control and measure power consumption of a block heater, battery warmer and battery charger combo. The reason for this is plugging your truck in all night doesn't make sense. Rather than wasting energy, ideally the block heater should kick in two to three hours before you need it.
[Portable Film Setup](http://wiki.arctichominid.ca/portable-film-setup)
   I need a few tripod rigs for filming things.
[FPV Quadcopters](http://wiki.arctichominid.ca/fpv-quadcopters)
   First person video quadcopter builds

   Off-grid future living	 
# Projects that require classification:
1. Smart Shed (Update from memory based on lost wiki data)
2. Raspberry Pi Zero W Portable Security Camera system (5VDC @ 1A)
    I checked into making these 3G/4G connected cameras but the power consumption is too high. This might still be tested in the future. Need more 8MP Pi cameras and ribbon cables.
3. Long Distance FPV Drone w/ APU and image stablized high resolution video (Requires Advanced RPAS certification or SFOC for larger 25kg drone)
4. Emergency Wildlife Taser (Need hockey stick and time to take apart a transformer and re-wrapping with new wire)
5. LED grow lights (Full spectrum LED COB modules, 110VAC, require significant heatsinking. 2x 5' LED modules arrived. Also test aerogarden with spices/herbs. Requires LED replacement bulbs.)
6. AGI-ESP8266 IoT plant monitoring system (HiGrow ESP32 module purchased for comparison data, requires programming)
7. CNC copper tubing and wire bending unit (Necessary for soil temperature regulation for AGI-ESP8266 project, requires a complete design based on similar projects.)
8. Arctic Snowmobiling Mask (Requires 3D printed parts)
# Small scale projects
1. ESP8266 IoT sensor nodes
    Wireless equipped (802.11b/g) microcontrollers for low power monitoring of Carbon Monoxide (MQ-7) and Temperature (DS18B20). Part of Smart Shed project.
2. 28BYJ Stepper motor control library (Required for projects involving low torque stepper motor control)
