# Projects
[Diesel Space Heater](http://wiki.arctichominid.ca/diesel-space-heater)
   I have begun testing a 17,000 BTU diesel air heater. I'm exploring it's potential use as a portable heater for use in arctic conditions.
[Hypercube 3D Printer build](http://wiki.arctichominid.ca/hypercube)
   A project involving the construction of a 200x200x200 3D printer.
[Supercapacitor Boost Pack](http://wiki.arctichominid.ca/supercapacitor-boost-pack)
   I stole Thor's hammer and I'm using it to power things.
[IoT block heater](http://wiki.arctichominid.ca/io-t-block-heater)
   I am looking at using an iTead Sonoff POW2 to control and measure power consumption of a block heater, battery warmer and battery charger combo. The reason for this is plugging your truck in all night doesn't make sense. Rather than wasting energy, ideally the block heater should kick in two to three hours before you need it.
[Portable Film Setup](http://wiki.arctichominid.ca/portable-film-setup)
   I need a few tripod rigs for filming things.
	 
# Smaller projects:
## FPV Quadcopters:
Currently have a total of two 5" FPV Quadcopters with controllers (1 custom build, 1 Eachine X220)

Todo:
- Silicone conformal coating required to waterproof electronics
- Slica aerogel battery blanket required for LiPo's
- Sort out camera and VTX issues, one Foxeer camera appears to be NTSC or shorted from destroyed PDB

These have really died in the water so to speak as I don't have an effective method of protecting the electronics against melting snow...yet.

# Project Planning
## Wireless and RF systems
Wireless networking:
I will be testing a >5KM link with a pair of Ubiquiti Networks Nanostation 5AC Loco devices in the next couple of weeks. If the tests go well, I will be rolling out a community wireless network for serving up free open source content like Wikipedia, Ted Talks, etc.

LoraWAN networking:
I will also be testing a 

Arctic ADS-B Receiver(s): This is part of a future project to provide localized flight tracking systems to several remote arctic communities for the purposes of public safety.
I have ordered five AirNav Radarbox Flightsticks, these are specially designed specifically for ADS-B and are pretty economical.
I am also waiting on five PCB high gain ADS-B antennas. Pair these both with a Raspbery Pi Zero W and you have a pretty cool project.

Software Defined Radio:
I have ordered a low noise amplifier and an upconverter for receipt of HF transmissions (Shortwave, AM radio, etc).
I already have a KerberoSDR which I'm looking at playing with as soon as I find a decent source for SMA connectors and RF cable.

SATNOGS:
Future tower system being planned for tracking passing satellites. I will likely fold in some form of reception for actively tracking satellites and constructing a multi-purpose RF reception tower. From DC to sunlight. xD

## Plant monitoring systems
AGI-ESP8266 project still in progress, a dozen esp8266 microcontrollers on hand pending completion of a side project for accurately bending copper pipe into fancy shapes.

Todo:
3D print planters and figure out sealant
Purchase seeds
Purchase components for building sand filled copper pipe bending CNC unit (Required for automating soil temperature window sill thermoregulation)
