# Projects
[Diesel Space Heater](http://wiki.arctichominid.ca/diesel-space-heater)
   I have begun testing a 17,000 BTU diesel air heater. I'm exploring it's potential use as a portable heater for use in arctic conditions.
[Hypercube 3D Printer build](http://wiki.arctichominid.ca/hypercube)
   A project involving the construction of a 200x200x200 3D printer.
[Supercapacitor Boost Pack](http://wiki.arctichominid.ca/supercapacitor-boost-pack)
   I stole Thor's hammer and I'm using it to power things.
[Solder Fume extractor](http://wiki.arctichominid.ca/solder-fume-extractor)
   I needed a solder fume extractor, so I made one.
[IoT block heater](http://wiki.arctichominid.ca/io-t-block-heater)
   I am looking at using an iTead Sonoff POW2 to control and measure power consumption of a block heater, battery warmer and battery charger combo. The reason for this is plugging your truck in all night doesn't make sense. Rather than wasting energy, ideally the block heater should kick in two to three hours before you need it.
[Portable Film Setup](http://wiki.arctichominid.ca/portable-film-setup)
   I need a few tripod rigs for filming things.
	 
# Smaller projects:
## FPV Quadcopters:
Currently have a total of two 5" FPV Quadcopters with controllers (1 custom build, 1 Eachine X220)

Todo:
- Silicone conformal coating required to waterproof electronics
- Slica aerogel battery blanket required for LiPo's
- Sort out camera and VTX issues, one Foxeer camera appears to be NTSC or shorted from destroyed PDB
- 3D PETG mount for Runcam 3S
- Finish printing tripod mounts for Runcam's (Require M4 buttonhead machine screws)

## Wireless and RF systems
Wireless networking:
Two Ubiquiti Networks Nanstation 5AC Loco point-to-point devices ordered
Test point-to-point link using power over ethernet injector

Arctic ADS-B Receiver(s): This is part of a future project to provide localized flight tracking systems to several remote arctic communities for the purposes of public safety.
Ordered five AirNav Radarbox Flightsticks
Ordered five PCB high gain ADS-B antennas

Software Defined Radio:
Ordered a low noise amplifier and an upconverter for receipt of HF transmissions (Shortwave, AM radio, etc)

SATNOGS:
Future tower system being planned for satellite tracking

## Plant monitoring systems
AGI-esp8266 project still in progress, a dozen esp8266 microcontrollers on hand

Todo:
3D print planters and figure out sealant
Purchase seeds
Purchase components for building sand filled copper pipe bending CNC unit (Required for automating soil temperature window sill thermoregulation)
