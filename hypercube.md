# Hypercube
I began this project last year. I was wondering if I could 3D print the parts for a 3D printer. I chose the Hypercube design by Tech2C on Thingiverse [available here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1752766)

In the next week or so, I'll update this page with photos and go through the build process step by step.

## Issues
I ran into a lot of small issues. Namely that I didn't have tiny bits of hardware like nuts or bolts to hold all the parts together. I got around that by just ordering a shit ton of them in bulk.
